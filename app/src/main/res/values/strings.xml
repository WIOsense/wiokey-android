    <!--  FAQ  -->
    <string name="faq_1_question">Which websites can I use the app with?</string>
    <string name="faq_1_answer">2-Factor Authentication can be used with any of the <a href="https://www.dongleauth.info/">U2F-supporting websites</a>. The complete passwordless experience is today only implemented by Microsoft and a few others. Stay tuned for updates on the FIDO2 deployment as well as our development of a FIDO2-independent solution.</string>

    <string name="faq_2_question">Why do you make use of my biometrics?</string>
    <string name="faq_2_answer">Because of the sensitive nature of the information being handled, we leverage the native biometric security of your phone to ensure that <b>only you</b> are able to look and manage it. Your biometric data never leaves your device, nor do we have any type of access to it.</string>

    <string name="faq_3_question">Can I use the app without biometrics?</string>
    <string name="faq_3_answer">You can always make use of pattern/PIN/passwords to verify against, but at least one type of screen lock verification must be enabled.</string>

    <string name="faq_4_question">How do I add a Bluetooth Device?</string>
    <string name="faq_4_answer">
        First you need to make sure that your phone is discoverable, for this go to the <b>Home</b> section, click on the connect button, and then select <b>+ Add new device</b>\n
        Then you must start pairing from your PC, for this go to your computer\'s <b>Bluetooth Settings</b> and click on add a new device. For more information on how to add a device you can check support for <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/15290/windows-connect-bluetooth-device">Windows</a>, <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/connect-a-bluetooth-device-blth1004/mac">MacOS</a></string>

    <string name="faq_5_question">What happens if I move my device away from my computer?</string>
    <string name="faq_5_answer">If your device stays within Bluetooth range(&lt;10m), you will receive push notifications of any incoming requests to log in or make a new crendential. You can safely ignore these, as the app needs your user input to authorize any action.\n\nIn case the Bluetooth connection is lost, the app will automatically try to reconnect once in range, but this is highly dependent on both your device\'s and computer\'s bluetooth chip. If this doesn\'t happen automatically, you can manually reconnect by pressing on the connect button in the home screen and picking your preferred device.</string>

    <string name="faq_6_question">I can\'t pair my device with my computer</string>
    <string name="faq_6_answer">Bluetooth may behave unexpectedly at times. Such problems can usually be mitigated by toggling the bluetooth connection on your phone and/or computer. One of them must be acting up :)</string>

    <string name="faq_7_question">I am not receiving a prompt on my phone</string>
    <string name="faq_7_answer">In this alpha release you need to make sure that your application is running in the foreground to receive the prompt. Depending on your device you can also get notification prompts with your app running in the background</string>

    <string name="faq_8_question">What happens if I lose my phone?</string>
    <string name="faq_8_answer">You do not need to be afraid about misuse of your credentials since your biometrics are required in order to use the app. Restoring your credentials is at this point in time not possible, but feel free to install the app on a new device and register a new key. Your old credentials will expire automatically.</string>

    <string name="faq_9_question">How are my credentials stored?</string>
    <string name="faq_9_answer">We store all your credentials locally in the native Android Keystore system. However, this does not mean that they are stored inside a secure hardware element. For us to be sure, we need at least one credential in the list, which can be generated in <a href="https://demo.wiokey.de">demo.wiokey.de</a>.\n\n
        Once you have generated your first credential/dummy credential, the storage type can be seen here:\n\n
    </string>
    <string name="faq_9_empty">No credentials have been generated yet!</string>
    <string name="faq_9_hardware">Keys are stored in <b>Hardware</b>! (TEE or Secure element)</string>
    <string name="faq_9_sofware">Keys are protected by <b>Software Encryption</b>!</string>

    <string name="faq_10_question">Can I delete my credentials?</string>
    <string name="faq_10_answer">You can easily manage your credentials by navigating to the <b>Credentials</b> section to see all of your registered credentials alongside relevant information like creation date. </string>

    <string name="faq_11_question">Can I backup/recover my credentials?</string>
    <string name="faq_11_answer">Backing up and restoring your credentials is at this point in time not possible. This is why we encourage everyone to follow the general Universal 2 Factor authenticaton recommendations and have a fallback secondary login solution that is not tied to the phone.</string>

    <b>Terms \u0026 Conditions</b>\n\n
        By downloading or using the app, these terms will
                  automatically apply to you ‚Äì you should make sure therefore
                  that you read them carefully before using the app. You‚Äôre not
                  allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or
                  our trademarks in any way. You‚Äôre not allowed to attempt to
                  extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn‚Äôt try
                  to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative
                  versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright,
                  database rights and other intellectual property rights related
                  to it, still belong to WIOsense GmbH \u0026 Co. KG.\n\n
        WIOsense GmbH \u0026 Co. KG is committed to ensuring that the app is
                  as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
                  reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
                  its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
                  charge you for the app or its services without making it very
                  clear to you exactly what you‚Äôre paying for.\n\n
        The WioKey app stores and processes personal data that
                  you have provided to us, in order to provide our
                  Service. It‚Äôs your responsibility to keep your phone and
                  access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
                  not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
                  removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
                  official operating system of your device. It could make your
                  phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
                  compromise your phone‚Äôs security features and it could mean
                  that the WioKey app won‚Äôt work properly or at all.\n\n
        The app does use third party services that declare their own
                    Terms and Conditions.\n\n
        Please check the Terms and Conditions of third party service providers used by the app\n\n
        \u2022 Google Play Services\n
        \u2022 Google Analytics for Firebase\n
        \u2022 Firebase Crashlytics\n

        You should be aware that there are certain things that
                  WIOsense GmbH \u0026 Co. KG will not take responsibility for. Certain
                  functions of the app will require the app to have an active
                  internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
                  by your mobile network provider, but WIOsense GmbH \u0026 Co. KG
                  cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
                  functionality if you don‚Äôt have access to Wi-Fi, and you don‚Äôt
                  have any of your data allowance left.\n\n
        If you‚Äôre using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                  should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
                  mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                  be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
                  the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
                  other third party charges. In using the app, you‚Äôre accepting
                  responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                  charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
                  (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
                  you are not the bill payer for the device on which you‚Äôre
                  using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
                  received permission from the bill payer for using the app.\n\n
        Along the same lines, WIOsense GmbH \u0026 Co. KG cannot always take
                  responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
                  make sure that your device stays charged ‚Äì if it runs out of
                  battery and you can‚Äôt turn it on to avail the Service,
                  WIOsense GmbH \u0026 Co. KG cannot accept responsibility.\n\n
        With respect to WIOsense GmbH \u0026 Co. KG‚Äôs responsibility for your
                  use of the app, when you‚Äôre using the app, it‚Äôs important to
                  bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
                  updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
                  to provide information to us so that we can make it available
                  to you. WIOsense GmbH \u0026 Co. KG accepts no liability for any
                  loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
                  relying wholly on this functionality of the app.\n\n
        At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
                  currently available on Android ‚Äì the requirements for
                  system(and for any additional systems we
                  decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
                  and you‚Äôll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                  using the app. WIOsense GmbH \u0026 Co. KG does not promise that it
                  will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
                  and/or works with the Android version that you have
                  installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                  accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
                  also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
                  it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
                  Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
                  rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
