This application adapts and extends the Bluetooth HID Device profile code package of 
the open source WearOS WearMouse application 
(https://github.com/ginkage/wearmouse/)

Bluetooth HID connectivity is an adaptation of the WearMouse WearOS Bluetooth HID Device
profile implementation changed to implement a FIDO2 compliant HID device descriptor report.
The code has been extended with a FIDO2 compliant HID device report descriptor, 
additional callbacks and device management interfaces to facilitate an easier 
handling of Bluetooth connections, sessions and devices.
